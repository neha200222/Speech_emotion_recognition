# Speech Emotion Recognition

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect emotions in speech. It uses a dataset of tweets labeled with emotions and trains a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to classify the emotions. The project also includes an interface to record audio, convert it to text, and predict the emotion.

## Objectives
- Develop a robust model to classify text data into different emotions.
- Utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and analyze text data.
- Implement a SimpleRNN model using Keras and TensorFlow.
- Provide a user-friendly interface to record speech and predict emotions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the text data for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Training and tuning a SimpleRNN model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy and validation accuracy.
- **Speech to Text**: Recording speech using a microphone and converting it to text.
- **Emotion Prediction**: Predicting the emotion of the converted text.

## Datasets
The project uses a dataset of tweets labeled with emotions for training and validation.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, SpeechRecognition, Pyttsx3
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git
